Lamellar plates can be constructed from lacquered leather, horn, or even stone, though suits of iron and steel are the most common. Lamellar armor can be crafted into various shapes, including partial pieces such as breastplates, greaves, or even entire coats.

This armor consists of a light breastplate and shoulder guards made from lacquered leather plates bound together and fitted over a silk shirt.",
